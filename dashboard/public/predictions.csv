If leader resolves NO, reduce/avoid follower YES exposure (or modestly sell/short follower YES if priced as if conflict were likely), since one major pathway to rapid regime change has failed to materialize—though Maduro could still exit for unrelated domestic reasons.","The leader market resolves ~59 days earlier and provides a discrete, high-salience signal about escalation. If engagement occurs, the follower market often lags in repricing regime-change probability (due to ambiguity about what 'engagement' implies and slow incorporation of political knock-on effects), creating a window to buy follower YES before it fully reflects the increased likelihood of Maduro being out by the later date.",916439,663850,2026-01-31T00:00:00Z,59d 12h,59.5

That resolution is new, high-salience information that should shift the probability of Maduro being out by 1/31/2026, but the follower market can remain mispriced briefly because 'engagement' is not identical to 'Maduro out' and traders may under/overreact; the trade captures this lagged repricing.",916438,916440,2026-01-15T00:00:00Z,16d 12h,16.5

Follower pricing may underreact or adjust slowly (or only partially) to that resolution because 'military engagement' is a narrower trigger than 'Maduro out' and traders may debate mechanisms; capturing the post-resolution repricing in the follower is the information-asymmetry edge.",664747,836172,2026-03-31T00:00:00Z,275d 12h,275.5

If it happens, many traders will update the 'Maduro out by end-2026' probability, but that repricing may be delayed/underweighted due to ambiguity about what 'engagement' implies and because the follower’s resolution is far later.
