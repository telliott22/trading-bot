A realized hike should cause a sharp repricing downward in the probability of an exceptionally dovish path (10 cuts), especially because achieving 10 cuts would likely require aggressive, repeated easing after having just tightened. If the follower market underreacts immediately after the March resolution (anchoring on pre-meeting narratives), a fast short on follower YES captures the information-asymmetry window.",654415,616912,2026-03-18T00:00:00Z,288d 0h,288.0,active,,,

If leader resolves NO (no 25+ bps hike after March 2026), bet follower YES (or cover/avoid NO), since the absence of a hike modestly increases the plausibility of a strong easing cycle later in 2026.","The March-hike outcome is a high-salience, early signal about the Fed’s 2026 policy regime (tightening vs easing) that should update expectations for the rest of 2026. The year-end '11 cuts in 2026' market can lag in repricing due to trader inattention and the long horizon, creating a window to short (on a hike) or reduce shorts/go long (on no hike) before the follower fully incorporates the new policy-path information.",654415,616913,2026-03-18T00:00:00Z,288d 0h,288.0,active,,,

If leader resolves NO, do not automatically bet follower YES; at most it modestly increases the chance of an easing cycle, but still doesn’t strongly imply 12+ cuts—only consider follower YES if the leader NO is accompanied by clear evidence of repeated cuts/rapid deterioration.","The March meeting provides early, high-signal information about the Fed’s 2026 policy regime and macro conditions. A confirmed hike strongly updates toward a tightening/steady-policy world, which is inconsistent with the extreme easing implied by 12+ cuts; if the follower market underreacts to that regime signal, shorting follower YES captures the lag.",654415,616914,2026-03-18T00:00:00Z,288d 0h,288.0,active,,,
